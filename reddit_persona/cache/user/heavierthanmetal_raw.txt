b'Sorry for title gore. This is my first python module, so if anyone has feedback (+ or -) I would love to hear it.  Don\'t tell Arnold Thanks Ken Folks with anxiety depression etc spend less free time out in the world and more free time socializing on the Internets. So redditors as a group are by self selection more more neurotic than than the average jagoff.  \n As someone pointed out you can mention introversion etc on Reddit without being ostracized and others can agree without the risk of social shame the real world brings. \nNot everyone identifies with these nerdy afflictions but it stands out here because when else do all the anxious people high five together about their weird fear fetish or being a homebody.  Gold No, weirder than that-- /r/theydidthemeth Imma smash Thanks for saying something factual in the sea of vitriol that is this thread. I came here to learn about what happened not watch people bitch about leaders and make conspiracy theories.\n\nNo one is discussing how CENTCOM could be telling the truth and the situation is shifting and complex, or even the possibility of something more subtle, like a communications or intel issue that wasn\'t resolved in time, and is being dealt with internally rather than publicized on global TV for the world to politicize.\n\n\nWho can really claim to know the facts- just because an interpretation confirms a strongly held bias or belief, or a particular theory is especially jarring, doesn\'t make it more true.. Excited to see what hardcore mode has to offer. \n12 damage from a lewis machine gun?  We\'rent those guns were chambered in 30.-06 or .303?

My impression as well. Adding a personally dimension could elucidate the causal factor, however I\'d assume it works both ways: video games have been shown to build spatial orientation skills, problem solving, task prioritization, etc \n\nAND \n\nnerds or people perceived to be smart*, ie the group that does well in STEM,  likely prefer mental stimulation found in games over (usually vapid) online social stimulation. \n\nNote: * I don\'t think nerds are smarter than normals, just that their minds are more drawn to symbolic analysis, as opposed to the intricacies of social, verbal, spatial, artistic arenas.

I recently built a PC for gaming/deep learning. It was about $800, high-ish end for gaming, low to medium end for deep learning.   The GPU computing part has been limited by two things. \n\nOne is the video memory on the GTX 970 is limited to 3.5GB, which limits the complexity of jobs. For example computing a neutral style transfer was around 100x faster than on my CPU, but the GPU couldn\'t produce images over 600px due to memory limits. The CPU uses the system RAM for me that\'s 16 GB so I could do bigger, more complex tasks, yet it was very slow- even if multiprocessing was involved, which can be complicated to program (paralell async processing is relatively easy, but not faster as it\'s just doing 4 slow jobs in paralell instead of one solo job on one core by itself). Either way it\'s amazingly slow on CPU.\n\n Now that the new nvidia cards are out, they are powerful and have more memory but expect to pay around $500 for the mid tier gtx 1070. \n\nThe other big challenge is Linux. Maybe I\'ll get called out by real CS or ML redditors for saying this but damn if it ain\'t hard to use Linux. On Ubuntu I tried installing the nvidia drivers once (following directions exactly) bricked my build, uninstalled them from rescue mode, did it again differently, then spent two whole days using bash to download dozens of dependencies, many with their own dependences, with their own dependencies. Sometimes they broke eachother, sometimes they broke my OS. I got it to work but the magnitude of hiccups when they occur leaves me for a distaste for Linix. I also did the same process on a cloud server which was easier with no GPU and could leave projects running on the server\'s CPU and still have a computer to use. \n\nI got Keras to work with Theano on Windows with my gpu, but most deep learning libraries won\'t work on Windows, including tensorflow, caffe, and actually just about anything else. So mostly I use Linux and pray there are no disasters brewing under the hood\n\n I guess my point is its not user friendly and it\'s a lot of work and $500 is how much a decent GPU costs provided you have the  compatible motherboard, CPU and RAM set to keep up with it. I wish I\'d had a mentor getting into it. Deep learning is also really cool and amazing and the future, just know it\'s bumpy terrain if you\'re not a statistician or Linux sysadmin.  No regrets, I\'d do it again because I learned a ton and it was mostly fun in retrospect, and now I\'m set up to try out cool things as they pop up on GitHub.  Interesting question. I\'ll throw some claptons in next time and see how it compaes. I wanted TC because I kept burning cotton, shouldn\'t be an issue now that I have rayon I\'ve noticed if I tip my mod + Sapor sideways with juice in it (or overjuice past the well) then later remove and replace the outer sleeve, it might kick me out of TC (this usually happens when I\'m fucking around with new coils - titanium is springy). When this happens, there is a big fat ring of juice under the RDA, from the juice on the inside of the sleeve acting as soppy lube and squishing past the RDA O rings, then getting stuck between the mod and RDA.\n\nIt took me a while to separate this from the 510 screw leak problem because the fat ring of juice under the RDA usually made it onto the mod\'s 510 pin as well. If the juice is JUST in your mod\'s 510 pin well, its the same issue I had. If it\'s a goopy mess, you just got a little too excited with the juice. Google yielded 2 similar posts before that offered a similar solution, but I didn\'t think to use silicon until the comments on this post. Hopefully future searchers find this one.

Now, if I could have done the same for homework I might have gotten a decent GPA.

Thanks, I agree 100%, yet it\'s crucial to note that not every one has that luxury. My Doc (and I assume many others) starts people out with lithium for a few years to stabilize them before considering other treatments.  It seems to be the consensus among psychiatry that Li is the best long term treatment, especially for prevention of sucide.  They want you to have a life to style! So for the Li-fers (seewhatididthere) small lifestyle changes like more powerade might make this med tolerable.

Now it\'s on PyPi, supports python3 and works better.  Made a module to extract personality insights from a redditor\'s text data  Sapor RDA leaking through 510 pin. My Sapor leaks through the center pin whenever I rejuice, constantly kicking my eVIC VT out of TC into power mode. So I remove the RDA, clean the mod out, by shoving a piece of paper towel into the mod, screw in RDA, try TC, and repeat the process until it works. Then, 20 minutes later, it happens again!\n\nI narrowed down the cause to juice leaking down the hole when the 510 and center block pop upwards - despite pin being locked down tight, whenever I screw in the RDA, the center block and the pin go \'click\' and pop up slightly, leaving a gap between the center post and the insulator where juice can leak into the insulator, then down the tube, around the tight screw into my mod. \n\nMy question is, how can I stop the screw/center post from popping up?\n\nTrying to fuck around with the 510 center post spring in my mod?  (sounds risky)\n\nJamming something in the RDA so that the post can\'t move? (if so, what material and how?)\n\nI really don\'t know. Disappointed in what is an otherwise amazing RDA.  Love the flavorful clouds, but its frustrating at best, damaging to my mod at worst. Kind of a deal breaker if not fixable.\n\n\nEDIT: Thanks to /u/To0nMan and /u/the_vapors, I had the idea to try screwing the 510 screw through a slice of silicon from the thin part of an [earbud cover] (http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/586/718/360/360718586_270.jpg), then trimmed off the excess around the screw. No Leaks so far!  Lithium, Hydration, Exercise. How I learned to stop worrying and love electrolytes Lets talk about Lithium and staying fit. \n\nWhile taking Lithium has in many ways transformed my life for the better, it has transformed exercise from a fun healthy life boost, into a nauseating march to an early death. Recently I found some workarounds, which have restored my ability to near-normal. I wanted to share because its awesome and I wish doctors told people from the start.\n\nI\'ve always stayed in relatively good shape with the occasional backpacking, climbing, bike ride. In all honesty I\'m a couch potato, but have a decent baseline of performance. I can take a perf hit in the name of sanity, but lithium stole 60% of my usual athletic ability, replacing it with nausea, tremors, and weakness, and having to puff on my inhaler every 20 minutes (instead of the usual never). It was twice as hard to do half as much, and not at all enjoyable. \n\nI used to lead 5.11 climbing routes, somewhere between intermediate to advanced difficulty... it was a challenge, but I enjoyed doing it. \nA few months on Li later, getting up a very short 5.8 (beginner level climbing) had me shaking uncontrollably, sweating profusely, and wanting to hurl.  What gives, I wondered - is it like this for everyone? Why don\'t doctors tell anyone this??\n\n\n\n\nBeing the complete nerd that I am, I did some research and found some useful info about the dangerous feedback loop that causes this and more importantly, how to fix it. (Feel free to skip to the past the nerd stuff to the solution if thats your jam.)\n\n**nerd stuff**, or what lithium does to your body that makes exercise and staying hydrated a serious and possibly dangerous challenge:\n\n\n1. Lithium carbonate releases lithium ions (Li+) in your body, which the body stores alongside te other mineral salts (aka electrolytes): Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Magnesium). \n\n2. Lithium is a diuretic - it can cause the body make a lot of pee (as I\'m sure you\'ve experienced). In the extreme (>2-3 L/day) this is called polyuria.\n\n3. This magnificent fluid loss can lead to electrolyte depletion. The body tries to balance this by excreting more urine, in order to maintain a healthy salts/water ratio with the salt it still has.\n\n4. This can cause dehydration, so the body tries again to maintain salt/water balance, this time by holding on to salts, which increases thirst. As the body treats the various mineral salts similarly, this also concentrates Lithium.\n\n5. The increased concentration of salts causes thirst, so you drink more, pee more, and steps 2-4 repeat in a loop. In the process, you continue piss out the bodies stored up reserves of electrolytes (N, K, Ca, Mg) all while concentrating Lithium.\n\n6. When you exercise and sweat more than usual, even more electrolytes are lost.\n\n7. In my experience the thirst while exercising is unquenchable. As in step 3, the body compensates for low eletrolytes by peeing more. When your body runs out of stored up salts, it has trouble holding on to any water, so you can become dehydrated while pounding liters and liters. Meanwhile the body also has been concentrating lithium the entire time (guessing its reserves are bigger than other salts since you take it every day)\n\n8. This can lead to some combination of electrolyte depletion, excessive lithium concentration, (unquenchable) dehydration. Each of these are dangerous and feel horrible, explaining the hardships of exercising on lithium, and why your friends still having fun and full of energy, while you feel like you are literally going to die.\n\nHere are some symptoms of each:\n\nLithium toxicity: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, lethargy, weakness, poor coordination (in fact dehydration is the reason many end up in the hospital for Li toxicity)\n\nElectrolyte depletion: same as above + muscle pain, headache, cramping\n\nDehydration: thirst, headache, lack of appetite, confusion, tiredness\n\n\n\n\n**The solution?** As you\'ve probably guessed: **Electrolytes!!!** I take some especially while exercising, and a little bit daily. I\'ve used Nuun tabs or Powerade powder, started a few days ago and I went from 40% of my physical capacity to more like 85% in one day. lol. I backpacked 15 miles with 2900ft elevation gain in 2 days, whereas two weeks earlier, a 4 mile hike had me in a world of pain. While working out, I feel stronger and more vital-  even my voice sounds fuller and louder.\n\nWhile this is great, note that too many electrolytes can crowd out the Lithium in your system, and cause many horrible problems of their own. Maybe start by drinking Power Aid while active, or if you are drinking > 2-3 liters of water a day and still not satisfied (my experience even while sedentary).\n\nVery important note: I am absolutely NOT a medical professional in any sense!!!! Just a mad scientist (literally and figuratively) who loves to learn why things happen. Drinking Power Aid isn\'t  generally something you need to talk to your Dr about, I\'d suggest to do it anyway, as it addresses a medical issue and can change Lithium blood levels. In my case, both my therapist and pharmacist recommended taking more electrolytes before I started.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR** Don\'t listen to the water boy- Gatorade is better than water. Lithium can cause a vicious cycle of dehydration, electrolyte depletion, and high Li levels- all of which contribute to a very bad time. Take Powerade, Gatorade, [Nuun] (https://www.amazon.com/New-Nuun-Active-Hydrating-Electrolyte/dp/B019GU4ILQ/ref=dp_ob_image_hpc) (my fav), to avoid this if excessively thirsty and peeing it all out.\n\n\n Line breaks removed after wGET .txt File Using wget to load a text file of my todo list from a dropbox shared link. Works fine, except the line breaks are removed from the file. Thinking this might have to do with encoding, or perhaps how WKGT processes text.. not sure how to fix it. I could take the easy route and use Google Keep, but I like  how taking notes in the \'monospace\' app feels.  Any ideas? Okay is amazing A profound thought struck me like lightning a few weeks after I started meds - Actually no - it was more like a warm tropical breeze.  "This is what people feel like."\n\nIt\'s been 6 months since I started lithium, and 4 since Lamictal, I\'ve finally gotten off of SSRIs - and now I feel okay..\n\nLet me explain how okay is the best thing ever - I am in a zone now where I can feel good, fun, happy, light hearted, enthused - but my feet never lift off the ground. It used to be I\'d get enthused, then my head would fill with big ideas and I would read, read, read, get super excited, go party, get really fucked up, be the first one awake and feeling fine, talk over people, rant and rave about my new passions, start new projects then half assedly abandon them for the next shiny thing, the whole time ramping up on coffee, cigarettes, weed, booze. I\'d get hyped, then I\'d get mad about the people who didn\'t get me, who couldn\'t see the amazingness of the Truth the way I could. The edgy semi-offensive comments would trickle into my speech patterns, slowly pissing off or pushing away those around me. I\'d fight with my partner. I\'d consider drastic life changes.\n\nThe buzz would fray at the edges. Edgy became \'on edge\' became \'on the edge\' became the abyss- and down I would fall like icarus for at least a few weeks, usually months. Isolation, burning and directionless hatred, existential ennui, melancholy, then apathy, numbness, bitter hopeless alienation. The whirlwind, the turbulence, the dance of life and death.\n\nBut now, none of that is happening, yet I still have the gift to feel intensely. Sometimes I\'m grumpy. I can be playful, creative, funny, driven, motivated, insecure, I sometimes stay up until 4am just cuz. I know I\'ll always be a little eccentric, cyclothymic, artistic, inspired, with moments of genius that sneak up and grab me like a wild tiger. However, the longer term rhythms seem to be fading to the background. The range of long term moods is dialed in, extremes aren\'t my territory. After a few hours, or a day, any mood just bounces back to normal, like there\'s an elastic tether holding me to middle ground.  I have patience when people talk, I can handle obstacles without taking it as a grand sign or indication of some tragic flaw. I have stepped off the rollercoaster, and it\'s super chill.\n\nI\'ts like the universe granted me the freedom to be me without the fine print, and it\'s amazing. I hope it happens to you.

It is amazing. Perfect flavor and no burnt hits. The problem with cotton is that even though I was using temp control, just one mistake turning it up a littttle too high would result in a nasty plume of smokey burnt wick into my lungs, not to mention ruining the wick. The difference between a warm hit and a smokey one was a very fine line, if there even was one. \n\nWith the Rayon, it tastes amazing and is much more forgiving with temps- I have yet to get even close to burning it, regardless of how warm I tune it. The material holds its shape in the coil, staying fluffy instead of clumping up like cotton does, and so provides a less crackley and more consistent vape. A $14 roll will last me a year. Between that and $12 of titanium wire, I am set for at least a year. My advice: do your lungs a favor and use a wick that doesn\'t want to turn into smoke so easily. I wish I had known about this earlier. "Really? You seem normal to me!" Grr This is a really annoying thing and is the main reason I don\'t want to share my diagnosis with people.  Assuming you can tell what my life is like by the outside view from an untrained eye is one step away from undermining the fact I have an illness and therefore just need to \'get myself together\'. It implies the person feels they have the judgment/authority to decide if I\'m ill, and therefore decide if I am worthy of their consideration as someone who deserves leeway or sympathy (not that I am looking for those things, I just want understanding). Why not leave the diagnosis to the mental health professionals? They have evaluated me more comprehensively and have the qualifications to understand what going on with me.\n\nWhat you don\'t see: I have a strong mind. Its a crazy mind, but willing and able to exert a good deal of energy and willpower in order to be normal. I feel like many people \'just are\' normal or close to normal. I can be normal, but only after spending 30-40% of my mental energy budget (at times closer to 100%) pushing back anger, fear, self loathing, self defeating impulses, thoughts of suicide, fiery hate, judgement, sloth, sadness, hopelessness, loneliness, emptiness, spaciness, mental clutter and confusion,  and trying to decide if I making a huge mistake right now without realizing it. \n\nWhat you don\'t realize: Its a matter of degree. Great, so we can both seem normal. How much energy does it take you to be that way? 5% of your energy? 25%? Do you ever lose control of the ability to act normal? Do you ever feel staying sane is like juggling greasy bowling balls? It happens to me. All the fucking time. I just hide how I am really thinking whenever I am around acquaintances, and often even family and friends. I\'ve gotten good at this act. "I\'m just a chill guy, got it under control, here\'s a joke and compliment and a funny story see ya later" This invisible double life is my illness. Its only a testament to my persistent efforts that you don\'t realize it. My superego goes to sleep when I\'m alone.\n\nI hate feeling like I need to explain this whole deal to people, and that it isn\'t just accepted, that people don\'t really understand what it means, and that I feel a tinge of social shame when exposing my self as BP. Don\'t get me wrong, I am extremely happy that I was diagnosed as my life history makes sense now and equally happy that people don\'t realize how insane I feel... i just want to be accepted and understood. How do you deal with this? Terms of Enrampagement, the Enrampaging: How Official309 was Liberated from the Chinese Hacker Mafia **First of all, thanks a billion to the Wildcard support staff who took care of this promptly and smoothly.** We could not have freed our server without them.\n\n**Backstory:** A Chinese tribe had been griefing the whole server with Aimbot hacks, hidden turrets, and a take no prisoners approach to diplomacy since the server\'s inception. Scores of tribes both very large and very small were driven away on a regular basis, as their was no competing with an enemy that could snipe you through metal walls from across the map, and who had turrets that could not be harmed or who\'s ill-gotten gains provided them with an unparalleled armory of explosives, high quality gear and advanced weaponry. \n\nAnyone who got to the metal tier was soon destroyed. No vault or dinos were safe, large empires rose and soon fell under the iron fist of these Chinese raiders. That was life on our server. After the Snow Biome was released which led to an asymmetric wiping of non hacker bases, there was a mass exodus. All of the biggest tribes left except for a handful. There was no beating MTBT, these players\' experience had been ruined by cheating bastards. \n\n**About a week ago**, my tribes main base was mercilessly pillaged, all dangerous dinos unceremoniously executed by these cruel thieving goons. It was\'t long after one of their members quoted Chairman Mao Tze Dong to me, "Political power comes from the barrel of a gun." Determined to subvert their brutalist ideology, I plotted my revenge. Thanks to Studio Wildcard, it was both short and sweet.\n\n**Fast forward to 24 hours ago**. Someone on global was mentioning they found video footage from fallen tribes of these hackers killing them with hidden turrets and aimbots and was considering reporting it. Intrigued, I searched for this footage on steam and was not disappointed.\n\nTaking /u/Nublsy- \'s advice, I sent their tribe name, player names, steam account, base location, along with a description of their typical unsavory activities to reports@studiowildcard.com. In addition I reached out on Steam to those who had been recently wiped, encouraging to submit their own reports. At least 4 or 5 did.\n\n**4 hours later**, while tracking a wild Quetz I ended up in the Hacker tribe\'s territory. *What had just two hours ago been a staggering metal fortress with more turrets and T Rexes than I felt like sticking around to count, was now reduced to a single stone foundation, owner "Bob".*Timestamp indicated it was last visited by Bob two hours ago. Thrilled but not sure what to believe, I scoped all their other base locations. They had all vanished, save for one, a bombed out shell of a building in the volcano\'s peak, which was now owned by the all powerful "Bob".\n\nBefore celebrations could commence, there was one last thing to be done. The Hacker\'s main allies, another Chinese tribe - one who had also participated the recent dino red wedding at our base- had to go down. The members of the wiped tribe were already talking to them on global chat, coordinating, regrouping, organizing.\n\nI knew that for this server to be fun again, both tribes needed to have no reason to ever come back. They needed to see only scorched and salted earth in their future. \n**And so we grinded mats for C4 into the wee hours**, and when we finally had a good amount, we hit them hard. Only one of their members was around, and he managed to lift me off our Argent, leaving my tribemate and I to fall precipitously. Luckily, we landed in water and returned to chase him off. Then, we returned to their base and\n**We. \nKilled. \nEverything.**\n\nAll dinos, all doors, all turrets, all electrical, all boxes, all beds, all boats, all bodies, everything was reduced to ash and dust. What was once a large base was now a hollow and useless carapace. Though we did lose some primo dinos and gear in this  battle for liberty, it was an easy sacrifice compared to the threat of their continued presence on our server. Justice was served hot and fast.\n\nThanks to everyone who helped in the big raid or by submitting their reports to Studio Wildcard, and thanks to the Studio for taking quick, decisive action. **Maybe soon this server will be thriving again**, and a more interesting and fair PvP will reappear where misery and fear once reigned at the hands of shameless cheaters. **It was a good day.** [BUG] Body travels on supersonic ocean adventure upon death- Impossible to retrieve.

Google Interview: Coding on Whiteboard Vs Chromebook I am preparing for an on-site interview at Google. During the candidate preparation class for interviewees, we were told we would have the option to code on a Chromebook in a basic text editor with syntax highlighting as an alternative to the whiteboard. \n\nAs someone who stopped writing in school around grade 3 and was instead trained to type on a keyboard, and someone who usually codes on a computer (haha), the Chromebook sounds preferable. Perhaps most importantly,  as a left hander, it is exceedingly hard to use a whiteboard without holding my arm at a strange angle to avoid erasing everything with my palm, which serves to makes my handwriting even less legible.\n\nThe folks at Google I have spoken to about this (sample size 2) seem to have the opinion that the whiteboard is an old-school rite of passage, and to use the computer might convey that one is not the caliber of software engineer they\'d hope for. Additionally, one of them said the whiteboard may serve to facilitate better communication between the candidate and interviewer.\n\nDoes anyone have opinions or experience with this choice? I am practicing on a whiteboard, but this only serves to highlight my preference to use the Chromebook/projector combo. It would be easier to manipulate the code, convey my ideas more clearly, and quickly. Better signal to noise ratio in my opinion.\n Question - can fertilized eggs be made into kibble? It seems like if the \'cooldown\' for breeding is faster than the average RNG drop rate, then breeding could be a shortcut to getting more eggs for kibble, or at least getting them more reliably and on demand. Has anyone tried this yet? The Travelling Hippie Problem  Dog or fruit baskets? You decide.  Dog or... fruit baskets? For once Deepdream actually reduced the number of dogs in an image. If you squint you can turn the fruit baskets back into a dog.  My favorite rendering so far. It looks so normal on the surface..  Just made a #deepdream website to host my creations. Feedback welcome!  Topamax- is it the devil? After a looking through a few posts on this sub it looks like topamax has been a traumatic experience for almost anyone who cares to comment on its use. Today is only my second day but I have to say so far its been amazing. The fog and tiredness I get from it is nothing compared to the apathy I have been feeling from the last five months of constant migraines and I already feel smarter and more excited about life. Just wanted to throw it out there for future readers that it may not always be bad. We\'ll see how it goes, but right now I am excited for the possibility of less painful days. Migraine and Work Does anyone else wonder where the line is for missing work due to migraines? I\'ve had at least 2 a week since a head injury earlier this year and I\'ve gotten to the point whee I just try to slog through it. I know I\'ll look pale and seem derpy and or distant but it seems better than missing tons of work.  Just came up with a way to actively monitor just what the hell I am doing with my life I was thinking about what I do with my time and how I have spent much of my time on frivolous but fun and short-lived activities. As with many ADHDers I tend to prioritize instantaneous reward instead of long term rewards or necessity and also have a heinously limited ability to ration out my time wisely.\n\n**Here is my idea:**\n\nEach activity in life can fall into **three tiers** of importance. A small amount of effort spent keeping tracking of which tier I\'m hanging out in could make a big difference in improving my quality life. Most people probably do this automatically.\n\nHere is each category, with some personal examples.\n\n\n***Tier 1) ESSENTIAL -***  This includes activities and responsibilities that if unheeded will fuck up my whole life.\n\n\n\n**Work** - having clean outfits to wear, to paying attention all day at my job to not partying or staying up too late on weekdays\n\n**Health** - diet and excercise\n\t\n**Relationship** - gotta stay on good terms with my girlfriend who has been there for me in more ways than I can count and is generally the highlight of my day\n\t\n**Zen** - my word for keeping a chill mind that is not ramping into the Danger Zone of anxiety and stress. Generally staying relaxed and positive!\n\n\n\n***Tier 2) FULFILLING -*** Any activity that deepens and enriches my experience of life but is not strictly necessary\n\t\n**Reading for knowledge** - science books, serious news articles, certain parts of Reddit\n\n**Education -** preparing for grad school, active learning\n\n**Playing music** - makes life so much better, enriches everything for me\n\n**Friends** - Gotta have \'em\n\n***Tier 3) TRIVIAL SHIT -*** Make no mistake I **love** the things in category, but they do not and can not sustain me physically or spiritually and generally constitute **short lasting rewards** that do not contribute to future me\n\t\n**Dicking around on the internet** - (Sorry reddit)\n\n**Partying -** Woo!!! My inner 18 year old is not running the show\n\n**Video Games -** Not counting Destiny, that is probably tier 2 for reals.\n\n**Going out -** Spending $30-40 to not be able to hear anyone talk and to slowly damage my health. Maybe this belongs in category 4 - Avoid.\n\n\n\n***Implementation:*** \n\nI will use this like a background widget running in my inner operating system, similar to monitoring RAM allocation in windows task manager. \n\n**I will check in as often as I am able to ask myself the following:** \n\nWhat category am I in now?\n\nIS this where I want to be?\n\nHow much of the day am I spending in each camp?\n\nWhat can I do that would be higher on the list?\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n**TL;DR - I made a 3-tiered system (simple enough to remember easily) to rank activities in order of importance to help me stay in control of my life!**'
